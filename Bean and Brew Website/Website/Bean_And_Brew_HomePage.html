    <h1>Welcome </h1>
    <p>Thank you for visting ur website. The exploration awaits to the world of being a connoisseur.</p>
    <p>Bean and Brew were one of the first
      companies in the UK to use fair-trade coffee
      and all organic milk for their products. Each
      drink is made exactly to your specifications,
      for a personal service. They also offer their
      trademarked flavoured coffees, breakfast
      items such as porridge, small sweet treats,
      and pressed sandwiches. Recently theyve also
      added frappes and fruit smoothies in addition
      to seasonal treats such as the pumpkin spiced
      latte  and various assorted
      baked goods.</p>
